            <li>Recent research shows that people with depression have increased folding in the occipital cortex</li>
            <li>This is linked to the course and severity of the depression</li>
            <li>This in turn suggests that occipital folding may predict the course of depression in an individual</li>

        <h2>What Causes Depression?</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Sometimes there can be a trigger for depression, such as a bereavement, job-loss or giving birth (post-natal depression) </li>
                <li>Some people may have a family history of depression, making them more likely to experience it themselves</li> 
                <li>Or, sometimes you can experience depression for no obvious reason</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Treating Depression</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>There are a combination of approaches used to tackle depression, such as lifestyle changes, talking therapies and medicines</li>
                <li>Talking therapies, such as Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT), are often used for mild depression that is not showing improvement, or moderate depression</li>
                <li>Sometimes antidepressant medication is prescribed</li>
                <li>For moderate to severe depression, a combination of both talking therapies and medication is recommended</li>

        <p1>Dr Dorothy Rowe was an Australian psychologist and author, with an interest in depression. She worked with patients diagnosed with depression, leading her to work within personal construc theory, rather than the usual medical model of mental illness. She believed that depression results from beliefs, making the person unable to live comfortably with themselves or the world. Therefore, part of recovery relies on accepting the unpredictable and the little control one has on the world.</p1>
