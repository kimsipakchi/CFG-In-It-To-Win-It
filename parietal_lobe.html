<h1>Parietal Lobe</h1>

<body>
    <!-- Intro section on the lobe itself-->
    <div class='Intro'>
        <ul>
            <li>Sometimes referred to as the ‘where system’, the parietal lobe determines spatial navigation as well as being a primary sensory area, meaning it is where sensory data in the brain is initially processed. </li>
            <li>Responsible for processing ‘somatosensory’ information from the body, including touch, temperature, pain and sense of limb position.</li>
            <li>Similarly to temporal lobes, parietal lobes are also involved in integrating information from other modalities. An example of this is converging visual information and motor/sensory information.</li>
            <li>Can be split into two: right and left lobe. Damage to the right lobe may lead to difficulty with images, spatial awareness and movement. Damages to the left lobe may lead to difficulty with functions related to symbols, such as language, mathematics, and writing.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="Condition">
        <!-- Section on the chosen condition-->
        <h2>Gerstmann’s syndrome</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Damage to the parietal lobe may result in what is known as Gerstmann's syndrome.</li>
            <li>This severely impacts one's ability to navigate around everyday life, such as spacial awareness and writing.</li>
            <li>While not considered a mental illness, learning difficulty in everyday life may have a great impact on a patient's mental health, and lead to depression, anxiety, etc.</li>
            <li>There are four main symptoms that must be present simultaneously for a Gerstmann's syndrome diagnosis:
                <ul>
                <li>Inability to write (dysgraphia or agraphia)</li>
                <li>Loss of the ability to do mathematics (acalculia)</li>
                <li>Inability to identify one’s own or another’s fingers (finger agnosia)</li>
                <li>Inability to make the distinction between the right and left side of the body</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>What Causes Gerstmann’s syndrome?</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>May occur due to reduced blood flow in the parietal lobe, which can be induced by a stroke or other vascular disease that drastically reduces blood supply.</li>
                <li>Can also be as a result of a tumour or damages to other parts of the brain</li>
                <li>Can also occur in children, which cause is still unknown</li>
                <li>Is sometimes associated with Alzeimers</li>
            </ul>
         <h4>Treating Gerstmann’s syndrome</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Special education and related rehabilitation and counselling services</li>
                <li>When brain injury or tumour involved, surgery may be used to alleviate condition</li>
                <li>In <u>some</u> cases, symptoms affecting adults with Gerstmann syndrome diminish over time, but this is not common</li>
            </ul>
